# Artificial-Intelligence

The aim of the project: to demonstrate smart behavior of virtual characters.
The game involves two teams of two characters in each of the teams who want to eliminate each other. The characters move in a maze with rooms and passages between them. Each character has life and ammunition and also in random rooms there are 2 lives and 2 ammunition. If the rival characters are in the same room, they shoot at each other and under certain conditions they go in search of ammunition or life. The group whose characters are killed is the loser.
